# ROM Builder for Ginkgo - Xiaomi Redmi Note 8/8T



Run the below on your home directory and follow instructions shown! 
NOTE: THIS WILL REMOVE ANY FOLDER NAMED GINKGO
```
rm -rf ginkgo && git clone https://github.com/rxuglr/ginkgo.git -b simplified && cd ginkgo && . run.sh
```

Refer to [***Tutorial***](https://github.com/rxuglr/ginkgo/wiki/Tutorial) for in-depth explaination.

Before you start building any ROM, make sure you have all the dependancies
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akhilnarang/scripts/master/setup/android_build_env.sh && bash android*
```

_To make another ROM, consider deleting the "ginkgo" folder and re-run the git clone because I maybe constanly updating these until I attain perfection.!!_

```
You must have prior ROM building experience, an inexperienced person using this is NOT recommended.
You may wish to use your own Local_manifest.xml file if you feel mine doesn't work.
```
