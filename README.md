# ROM Builder for Olivewood
## _Only tested on Olivewood for now_


Run the below on your home directory and follow instructions shown! 
```
git clone https://github.com/geek0609/olivewood.git -b simplified && cd olivewood && . run.sh
```

Refer to [***Tutorial***](https://github.com/geek0609/olivewood/wiki/Tutorial) for in-depth explaination.

Before you start building any ROM, make sure you have all the dependancies
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akhilnarang/scripts/master/setup/android_build_env.sh && bash android*
```

_To make another ROM, consider deleting the "olivewood" folder and re-run the git clone because I maybe constanly updating these until I attain perfection. Don't forget to keep giving me suggestions and report issues in my script!!_

```
You must have prior ROM building experience, an inexperienced person using this is NOT recommended.

You may wish to use your own Local_manifest.xml file if you feel mine doesn't work.
```

If you have any issues or doubts, ask other fellow developers or me on [**telegram**](https://t.me/olivewood_devs). You can tag me @dsashwin!!

Enjoy!
